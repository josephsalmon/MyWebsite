Code is important in applied research. Here are some of the code I have written over the years.

- [peerannot](https://peerannot.github.io/): a package to make transparent and reproducible comparisons between annotation algorithms, especially in the context of citizen science.
- [OrganizationFiles](https://github.com/josephsalmon/OrganizationFiles): This repository provides some tools, advice and guidelines for researchers working in applied mathematics, statistics or machine learning.
- [BenchOpt](https://benchopt.github.io/): a package to make transparent and reproducible comparisons between optimization algorithms
- [PlantNet-300K](https://github.com/plantnet/PlantNet-300K): a subset of the [Pl@ntNet](https://plantnet.org/) database, with about 300k labeled images (plant species) and 1k classes. The dataset is available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/5645731#.Yuehg3ZBxPY).
- [Celer](https://mathurinm.github.io/celer/): a fast Lasso solver (associated ICML2018 paper "Dual Extrapolation for Faster Lasso Solvers"), [pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07481), [slides](http://localhost/talks/UBC.pdf)
- [sparse-ho](https://github.com/QB3/sparse-ho): a fast hyper-parameter package to select the best Lasso parameter efficiently (associated to ICML2020 paper "Implicit differentiation of Lasso-type models for hyperparameter optimization", [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08943.pdf))
- [matlab toolboxes](../code/index_codes.php) for statistics and image processing (this is legacy), I don't use Matlab anymore.
