In this blog, I intend to talk about things I like, powered by Quarto, Python, and a bit of Observable for some visualizations.
You can expect math, stats, machine learning, biking and whatever I feel like sharing.
And sometimes, I will also share things  just because I find them nice...


I shall also mention

- [Emil Hvitfeldt's blog](https://emilhvitfeldt.com/blog)
- [Freakonometrics](freakonometrics.hypotheses.org)
- [ploum.net](ploum.net)

who are all great sources of inspiration.
